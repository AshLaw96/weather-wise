Weather Wise is a weather quiz that users can play to help improve there knowledge about weather and is a fun game for all ages.

When a user first opens the quiz it will show a menu with a title and a brief overview of what it actually is. Below this it will then show a list of options with what the user would like to do next. Depending on there choice it will either start the game, show the instructions on how to play the game or quit the game. If the user inputs an incorrect value they will then be informed that whatever they have just inputted was incorrect and they need to write either 1, 2 or 3 depending on there choice. With the first option been chosen, it will then ask the user what level of difficulty the user would like for example easy, medium or hard. Again if the user inputs an incorrect value it will tell them that they have done so and need to write either 1, 2 or 3. Following there choice it will then ask how many questions they would like to answer for example 10, 25 or 50. Once more if the user didn't type a correct value it will tell them so and that they need to type either 1, 2 or 3. After this the app will then access data from the questions library and start asking randomly chosen multiple choice questions up until the user has answered there desired amount, for example what is rain? a. god peeing b. condensation from clouds c. water squirting from plains d. water that falls from clouds in the sky, that happens when tiny water droplets in the clouds join together and become too heavy to stay in the air. Once again if the user doesn't input a, b, c or d for any question they will be told to write a correct value from the options given. When the quiz has been finished there score will be toted up and then shown to the user, then the user will be asked if they would like to play again or quit the game. If the user doesn't input a correct value again they will be informed of this and asked to input a correct value. Providing they have chosen a correct value it will either take them to the menu or show message saying thank you for playing, goodbye. However at the menu screen if the user inputted the second option the app will then show the user how to play the quiz and once they have read this it will ask if they want to play again. Finally if the user chose the last option it will then double check they want to quit and if they do show the thank you for playing, goodbye message.

## Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was developed to show the plan of the app and how it should work. I used [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to design my apps flowchart.

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Header section**

  - This will show the user what the app is called and a brief explanation of what it actually does.  

![screenshot](documentation/features)

- **Asks user question**

  - The app will first ask the user if they would like to input a location or if they would like to use there current location.

![screenshot](documentation/features)

- **Find users current location or ask user to input a location**

  - Depending on the users previous answer the app will either ask the user to input a location or try to locate where the user is based.

![screenshot](documentation/features)

- **Check users input is correct**

  - The app will make sure the user has inputted a valid location, if not an error will appear letting the user know that there input is incorrect and will have to try again. However if the user is correct the app will then request a library to send an API call to a external weather website and pull data from this.

</details>

- **Users location**

  - If the user chose to allow the app to access the users current location the app will then process this and if successful will use it to access data from an external weather website by requesting a library to send an API call to this site. However if the app cannot find the users location, it will show an error message informing the user of this and will then ask if they would like to try again or input there own location.

</details>

- **Show dictionary of key value pairs**

  - The app will then show the user a variety of weather information, informing the user of the weather of there chosen location.

### Future Features

1. Allow user to input 2 locations at the same time so they can compare the weather easily.
2. Add icons of different weather conditions for a more visually pleasing weather app.

## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using a free version of
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) and/or [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io).

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

### Classes & Functions

The program uses classes as a blueprint for the project's objects (OOP). This allows for the object to be reusable.

```python
class Person:
    """ Insert docstring comments here """
    def __init__(self, name, age, health, inventory):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.health = health
        self.inventory = inventory
```

The primary functions used on this application are:

- `get_sales_data()`
    - Get sales figures input from the user.
- `validate_data()`
    - Converts all string values into integers.
- `update_worksheet()`
    - Update the relevant worksheet with the data provided.
- `calculate_surplus_data()`
    - Compare sales with stock and calculate the surplus for each item type.
- `get_last_5_entries_sales()`
    - Collects columns of data from sales worksheet.
- `calculate_stock_data()`
    -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%.
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

- `gspread`: used with the Google Sheets API
- `google.oauth2.service_account`: used for the Google Sheets API credentials
- `time`: used for adding time delays
- `os`: used for adding a `clear()` function
- `colorama`: used for including color in the terminal
- `random`: used to get a random choice from a list

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://weather-wise-project-e6ccd7a6b753.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.
